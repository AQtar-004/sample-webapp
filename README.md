# sample-webapp
This is a simple Java web application built using Apache Maven with WAR packaging, designed for deployment on servlet containers like Tomcat. The project follows a standard Maven structure and includes a basic configuration for building, testing (with JUnit), and deploying a webapp. After cloning the repository, you can build the application using mvn clean install, which generates a .war file in the target/ directory. This WAR can be deployed on any compatible server such as Apache Tomcat or hosted on cloud platforms like AWS EC2. Ideal for beginners learning Maven-based Java web development.
